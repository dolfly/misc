	- Added -m and --max-rounds options which limits the number of
	  randomization rounds. For example, -m 1 will cause the randomization
	  to be done only once.
	- Added -e and --max-events options which cause the program to exit
	  after first randomization that realizes the event (command).
	- Added --sleep option which can be used to specify sleep time
	  between rounds. The default is 1 second. Floating-point values
	  are allowed. Accuracy depends on the underlying kernel. Note
	  that given time interval must not be less than the sleep time.
	- There is now an alternative to specifying time interval. One can
	  give p=x instead of time interval. p=x means that an event happens
	  with probability x on each round. The relation between x and
	  time interval is:
	      p = sleep_time / time_interval
	  By default sleep_time == 1.0. --sleep option can be used to 
	  specify it.

	- Added quiet option (-q) to not print the time index when a command
	  is run.
	- Added simulatio option (-s) which means not to run the command and
	  not to sleep. It is useful for testing the probability distribution.
	  Try:
	       poissonrun -s 64 echo foo 2>&1 |head -n 10000
	  The last line should be close to 640000 seconds, but of course
	  randomness does not quarantee it ;)
