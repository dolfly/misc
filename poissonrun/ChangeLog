	- Added quiet option (-q) to not print the time index when a command
	  is run.
	- Added simulatio option (-s) which means not to run the command and
	  not to sleep. It is useful for testing the probability distribution.
	  Try:
	       poissonrun -s 64 echo foo 2>&1 |head -n 10000
	  The last line should be close to 640000 seconds, but of course
	  randomness does not quarantee it ;)
