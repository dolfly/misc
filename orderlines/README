orderlines 0.1

USAGE: orderlines [-0] [-c] [-h] [-r]

DESCRIPTION:
orderlines reads all lines from stdin, and then prints them in a specific
order. By default the order is reverse order.

 -0 / --null       Make \0 as the separator instead of \n. Potentially
                   useful with 'find -print0'.
 -h / --help       Print help.
 -c / --check      Force /dev/urandom check for -r.
 -r / --randomize  Print out in random order.

PROBLEMS:
Operating systems which don't have /dev/urandom use time(0) to initialize
seed for srand48(). With -c option, error is given if /dev/urandom is not
available.
